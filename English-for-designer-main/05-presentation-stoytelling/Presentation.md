<h1>Redesign of Czech sports logos</h1>
<h3>Slide 1</h3>
Hello, my name is Zdeněk and I have a presentation about redesign sports logos.

<h3>Slide 2</h3>
I want to speak about three new identites of Czech sports asociations, Czech Hockey, Czech Florball and Czech Volleyball. 

I chose this topic because I am active person and I love sports. I have been playing hockey as a goalkeeper since I was a child.
<h2>Ice Hockey</h2>
<h3>Slide 3</h3>
First of all we will look at the logo of Czech Hockey.
Logo was designed by Go4Gold company, which is focusing on only sport brand logo designs.

<h3>Slide 4</h3>
 Here you can see the difference between new and old logo. When you look on the old logo you have to see it's calling for change.

<h3>Slide 5</h3>
The new dynamic logo is inspired by the lion which - as the country’s official symbol - has been present on the jerseys of Czech ice-hockey players for almost a hundred years. The logo’s coloring is based on the colors of the Czech national flag, and it is supplemented with “ice” shading. The lion is firmly connected with the puck, much as ice-hockey is associated with modern Czech history. The six spikes of the lion’s mane refer to six players on the ice, and if you take a closer look at the lion’s eye, you will discover the outline of the island of Štvanice in Prague, which is were the Czechoslovaks won their first ever world championships.

 <h3>Slide 6</h3>
For every category logo is slightly changed. In text or even in logo itself. In national team of adults we can see for example gold crown. 

 <h3>Slide 7</h3>
You can see the differences in the logos for each category. The icons for the men's national team are dominated by blue and they are different only in the age value of each category. In the national women's team we can see the dominance of red and in sledge hockey gray-blue. For those who don't know what it's about, sledge hockey is for hockey players with physical disabilities and it's played on a specially adapted sled.
The logo for each region is different in the text. On the bottom you can see the logo for an organization which focuses on youth development.

 <h3>Slide 8</h3> 
The whole logo looks great. The biggest criticism had when it was used on hockey jerseys of our national team. We had one of the most beautiful jerseys in my opinion. It looks like a dress, which u can get for free when you buy two cans of cola.

<h3>Slide 9</h3>
<h2>Floorball</h2>

Next, here we have logo for Czech Floorball and it was made by Prag Design Studio Dynamo. 

<h3>Slide 10</h3>

You can see the difference between new and old logo. 
The old logo was only symbolic and didnt appear anywhere. So this is not a complete redesign, but a complete creation of a new identity.

<h3>Slide 11</h3>
You can see a photo of the sketches here.

<h3>Slide 12</h3>
The new logo consists of three elements, Czech Lion, Floorball stick and Goalkeeper's mask. 

<h3>Slide 13</h3>
This creates a lion's head, which looks like a goalkeeper's mask or a blade of floorball stick.
You can see how logo is used in practice, specifically on promotional materials.

<h3>Slide 14</h3>
Artists did very great job and made easy to recognize and modern logo.


Here u can see other options for different gender. For men it is lion and for women it is Lioness.


The logos of extra-league competitions are the most frequently used symbols in the communication of Czech floorball, and therefore it was necessary to ensure their visual connection with the new logo and at the same time highlight the categories of men and women – lion and lioness. 
This new design is still evolving so it is not completed in all categories as we could see in the redesign of Czech hockey


¨

<h2>Volleyball</h2>
<h3>Slide 15</h3>
And last we have here logo of czech volleyball which is the best of these three redesigns in my opinion. It was also made by Design Studio Dynamo.
<h3>Slide 16</h3>
Here you can see the difference between new and old logo.

The purpose of the design was for the public to perceive volleyball as a strong and confident sport with a historical tradition and sport with a vision for the future.

<h3>Slide 17</h3>
The main motive of the new logo is the reflected volleyball ball, which renders the letter V. Its reflection symbolizes the smash and the point obtained. The letter V refers to the words “volleyball” and “victory”.  national symbols and sports dynamics.
<h3>Slide 18</h3>
For each type of volleyball they changed colors. Yellow means for Beach volleyball, blue for snow volleyball and colorfull for mini volleyball.
<h3>Slide 19</h3>
All of these logos they needed a redesign and in my opinion it was well made so I think they will stay in our presence for many years. Thanks you for your attention.
